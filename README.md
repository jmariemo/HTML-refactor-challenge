# HTML-refactor-challenge
## UCB Bootcamp Module 1 Homework Challenge
This is my resubmission for the UCB Bootcamp Module 1 Homework Challenge. 
This submission corrects bugs provided in feedback for attempt 1, including adding IDs to the HTML section that correspond to the HREFs to allow for functioning nav links, adding comments to the CSS & HTML to allow for greater readibility of code function, assigning a unique and descriptive name to the project, replacing all div tags with semantic tags, and adding a screenshot of the project to the README.
